<h1> BRAC University Co-curricular Hub (BUCH) </h1>

<h3>Project Overview</h2>
<p>BUCH is a centralized web platform developed to simplify and enhance interactions between BRAC University's Office of Co-Curricular Activities (OCA) and club panel members. This system addresses major administrative challenges, including delays in event approvals, fragmented communication, inefficient room booking processes, lack of transparency in budget approvals, and a need for data-driven insights. By providing an organized digital hub, BUCH improves operational efficiency, transparency, and the overall user experience for both OCA and club members.
